# Five types of tests

## Unit Tests
Test functionality of individual units, generally an object or a method (or even more specific). Generally whitebox style testing, with lots of mocking.
## Integration Tests
Test the intersections of distinct units. Limited mocking, lean more toward greybox or blackbox testing.
## E2E Tests
Test end to end functionality with no mocking, a live network, and real IoTHubs
## Stress Tests
- Coming Soon
## Scenario Tests
