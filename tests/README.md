# Five types of tests

## Unit Tests
Test functionality of individual units. Generally whitebox style testing, with lots of mocking.
## Integration Tests
Test the intersections of distinct units. Limited mocking, lean more toward grey or blackbox testing.
## E2E Tests
Test end to end functionality with no mocking, a live network, and real IoTHubs
