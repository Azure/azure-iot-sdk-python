# Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs for Python

![Build Status](https://azure-iot-sdks.visualstudio.com/azure-iot-sdks/_apis/build/status/python/python-canary)

This repository contains the following:
* **Azure IoT Hub Device SDK for Python**: to connect client devices to Azure IoT Hub
* **Azure IoT Hub Service SDK for Python**: enables developing back-end applications for Azure IoT
* **Azure IoT Hub Provisioning Device SDK for Python**: to connect client devices to Azure IoT Hub Provisioning Service
* **Azure IoT Hub Provisioning Service SDK for Python**: enables developing back-end applications for Azure IoT Hub Provisioning Service

To create and manage an instance of IoT Hub in your Azure subscription using Python, you can use the [Azure IoT Hub management library for Python][azure-iot-mgmt-lib]. Read more [here][azure-iot-mgmt-lib-doc].

To manage all your Azure resources using Python, you can leverate the [Azure CLI v2][azure-cli-v2].

To find SDKs in other languages for Azure IoT, please refer to the [azure-iot-sdks][azure-iot-sdks] repository.

## IMPORTANT INSTALLATION notes - Dealing with `ImportError` issues

The current version of the Azure IoT SDK for Python is a wrapper over [our C SDK](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-c). It is generated using the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) library. Because of that, it comes with several significant limitations:
- Boost and other C dependencies should be installed on the system for the PIP package to work, or the SDK to be built.
- Only a handful of "golden configurations" OS images are supported by the PIP package, because they have the right dependency tree:
  - Ubuntu 16:04 + Python 3.5 (or 2.7) + libboost-python-dev + libcurl4-openssl-dev + python3-dev (or python-dev for 2.7)
  - Windows 10: Python 3.6 corresponding to your CPU architecture (the default download on python.org is x86 and will not work if running on x64)
  - Raspbian Stretch: + Python 3.5 or 2.7 + libboost-python-dev + libcurl4-openssl-dev + python3-dev (or python-dev for 2.7)
  - Mac OS: Python 3.7.0 (or 2.7) + libboost-1.67 + curl 7.61.1 (all installed via homebrew)
Any other distribution/OS probably embed different versions of boost & dependencies which won't work and will result in an `ImportError` at runtime.

The [dockerfiles](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/tree/master/dockerfiles) folder in this repository provides examples of configurations that successfully build the SDK or run the pip packages. We would absolutely welcome contributions to this folder to add more configurations.

*my version is not in this list and I need support*: you always have the option of [rebuilding the sdk][devbox-setup].

We are fully aware that this is a less than ideal situation and we are currently working on a full python implementation that will have the wide platform support that is expected of any respectable python library. While we intend to support this wrapper-based version of the SDK until the new one is full-featured, we will be deprecating it shortly thereafter. We will update this readme with the link to the new preview version when it is available.

## How to use the Azure IoT SDKs for Python
Devices and data sources in an IoT solution can range from a simple network-connected sensor to a powerful, standalone computing device. Devices may have limited processing capability, memory, communication bandwidth, and communication protocol support. The IoT device SDKs enable you to implement client applications for a wide variety of devices.
* **Using PyPI package on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) or Raspberry Pi**: the simplest way to use the Azure IoT SDK for Python to develop device apps on Windows is to leverage the PyPI package which you can install following these [instructions][PyPI-install-instructions].
* **Clone the repository**: This repository uses [GitHub Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for its dependencies. In order to automatically clone these submodules, you need to use the `--recursive` option as described here:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git
```
If you have downloaded the zip instead of cloning the repository, you will need to run the following command to restore submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* **Building the libraries and working with the SDK code**: follow [these instructions][devbox-setup].

# Long Term Support

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

A new LTS version will be created every 6 months. The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes (crashes, memory leaks, etc.)

No new features or improvements will be picked up in an LTS branch.

LTS branches are named lts_*mm*_*yyyy*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_07_2017*.

## Schedule<sup>1</sup>

Below is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the packages released
