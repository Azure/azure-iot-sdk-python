# NOTE ON TEST IMPLEMENTATION:
# Despite having significant shared implementation between the sync and async handler managers,
# there are not shared tests. This is because while both have the same set of requirements and
# APIs, the internal implementation is different to an extent that it simply isn't really possible
# to test them to an appropriate degree of correctness with a shared set of tests.
# This means we must be very careful to always change both test modules when a change is made to
# shared behavior, or when shared features are added.
