class PipelineOperation(object):
    """
    A base class for data objects representing operations that travels down the pipeline.

    Each PipelineOperation object represents a single asyncroneous operation that is performed
    by the pipeline. The PipelineOperation objects travel through "stages" of the pipeline,
    and each stage has the opportunity to act on each specific operation that it
    receives.  If a stage does not handle a particular operation, it needs to pass it to the
    next stage.  If the operation gets to the end of the pipeline without being handled
    (completed), then it is treated as an error.

    :ivar name: The name of the operation.  This is used primarily for logging
    :type name: str
    :ivar callback: The callback that is called when the operation is completed, either
      successfully or with a failure.
    :type callback: Function
    :ivar needs_connection: This is an attribute that indicates whether a particular operation
      requires a connection to operate.  This is currently used by the EnsureConnectionStage
      stage, but this functionality will be revamped shortly.
    :type needs_connection: Boolean
    :ivar error: The presence of a value in the error attribute indicates that the operation failed,
      absence of this value indicates that the operation either succeeded or hasn't been handled yet.
